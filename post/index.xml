      <title>Hugo v0.93.0 - Mermaid Diagrams</title>

      <description>Hugo currently does not provide default templates for Mermaid diagrams. But you can easily add your own. One way to do it would be to create
layouts/_default/_markup/render-codeblock-mermaid.html:
1&amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;mermaid&amp;#34;&amp;gt; 2 {{- .Inner | safeHTML }} 3&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; 4{{ .Page.Store.Set &amp;#34;hasMermaid&amp;#34; true }} And then include this snippet at the bottom of the content template (below .Content):
1{{ if .Page.Store.Get &amp;#34;hasMermaid&amp;#34; }} 2 &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; 3 &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; 4 mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true }); 5 &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; 6{{ end }} With that you can use the mermaid language in Markdown code blocks:</description>

      <description>Introduction ¶This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static ¶Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
