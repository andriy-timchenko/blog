1{{ if .Page.Store.Get &amp;#34;hasMermaid&amp;#34; }} 2 &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; 3 &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; 4 mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true }); 5 &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; 6{{ end }} With that you can use the mermaid language in Markdown code blocks:</description></item><item><title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title><link>https://blog.timchenko.pp.ua/post/goisforlovers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.timchenko.pp.ua/post/goisforlovers/</guid><description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine.
